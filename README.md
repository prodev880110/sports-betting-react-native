# reactnative_sports_betting_app
A Sport betting Mobile app built with ReactNative
Sports odds and data fetched from <a href="https://www.betconstruct.com/products/sportsbook">BetConstruct</a>

# Note
* This Project has no proper documentation and commetting. 
You would have to go through the codes to really understand the flow and how it works.
* Files structure is poetic and self-descriptive
* Most of the functions are poetic hence it should be easy to tell what they do.

* Apart from the RN entry files, all the app code reside in root_directory/APP
